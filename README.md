# This is what I learned while revising OOP in Kotlin.
# OOP Concepts in Kotlin

# What is OOP?

OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming. In OOP language, we divide the code into classes. 
These classes hold related objects(instance of class that represent real world entities), variables, functions and constructors (special type of functions), etc. 
By dividing our project into classes, we can take advantage of these classes to implement inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation, etc. 

--- 

# What is inheritance?
Inheritance comes into play when we have more than two classes and one (or many) of the classes acts like 'parent or superclass' and the other one (or many) acts like 'subclass'. 
Superclass is generalized class and subclass is specialized class.

# What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism in Kotlin means that objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass. 
It allows you to use a single interface to represent various types of objects and call their methods, making your code more flexible and reusable.

# What is abstraction?
Abstraction in Kotlin means hiding complex details and showing only essential features of an object. 
It's like using a remote control without knowing how it works internallyâ€”just press the buttons to make it work. 
Abstraction helps simplify and manage code.

# What is encapsulation?
Encapsulation in Kotlin means wrapping data (variables) and the code (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (a class). 
It's like putting your belongings in a suitcase; you can control access to them and prevent unwanted changes. 
Encapsulation helps maintain data integrity and security.
